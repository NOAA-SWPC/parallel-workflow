 JOB script changes:
   All job scripts:
    - Use variable $RUN rather than $model to set the default COMIN and COMOUT
      directory basenames for GFS job scripts because variable $model is now
      used by NCO for another purpose.
    - Use new variable $RUND rather than $model to set the default COMIN and
      COMOUT directory basenames for GDAS job scripts because "$model" now used
      by NCO for another purpose. (Use of $RUND rather than $RUN for GDAS
      scripts is temporary to get through "gdas1" to "gdas" transition).
    - Changed default RUN from "gdas1" to "gdas" for GDAS jobs due to new file
      naming convention for 2017 GFS upgrade.
    - Added shebang to use /bin/bash interpreter
    - Reorganized to set execution trace prompt string (PS4) closer to the top
    - Added Module package initialization so that the module function can be
      found to list currently loaded modules when running on luna and surge
      (which currently use a setup that does not export the module function to
      child scripts)
    - Made variable jobid expandable to preserve the setting exported from NCO
      wrapper scripts.
    - Explicitly copy needed prod utils to the working directory (in place
      of old setup.sh)

   JGDAS_DUMP, JGFS_DUMP:
    - Removed load of grib_util module (latest preferred practice is to load 
      modules in the parent environment).

   JGDAS_PREP, JGFS_PREP:
    - Added new variable NEMSIO_IN with default setting of ".true." to tell
      obsproc_prep software whether to process nemsio global forecast files
      vs the older sigio files.
    - Added new variables COMINgdas and COMINgfs needed by new getges script.
    - Removed load of util_shared module (no longer needed)
    - Use variable $NWROOTp1 to find decoder dictionary directory.
    - Removed NPROCS.  (This variable is now set if needed in obsproc_prep)
    - Added variable PROCESS_UNBLKBUFR with default of "NO" (see related change
      for exglobal_makeprepbufr.sh.ecf, below).

   JGDAS_DUMP_POST and JGFS_DUMP_POST:
    - Use new directory $COMROOT/gfs/$envir/sdm_rtdm to hold obcount_30day and
      avgdata directories which contain dump status info to help the SDM 
      monitor changes in data counts.

   JGDAS_DUMP_POST :
     - Changed default setting for PROCESS_UNBLKBUFR to "NO", turning off
       creation of copies of bufr dump files with the "unblok" extension.

   JGDAS_PREP_POST:
    - Changed default location for DATACOM* variables from /com/arch/$envir to
      $COMROOT/gfs/$envir/gdascounts.
    - Changed default location for SATCOM* variables from $COMROOT/gfs/$envir to
      $COMROOT/gfs/$envir/gdascounts.
    - The naming convention for SATCOM subdirectories was also modified from
      satcounts/$MON to satcounts.$YYYYMM to ease maintenance.
    - The default location for the VOS ship names archive remains under
      $COMROOTp2/arch/$envir because downstream usage is from the IBM.

   JGDAS_PREP_POST and JGFS_PREP_POST:
    - Added variable PROCESS_UNBLKBUFR with default of "NO".

 Model script changes:
   exglobal_dump.sh.ecf:
    - Run under ksh.  Necessary on luna and surge in order to create here-docs
      if variable TMPDIR was imported in an lsf job.
    - Added logic to determine if running on Cray-XC40 or IBM iDataPlex.
    - Added MPMD logic for running on Cray-XC40 or IBM iDataPlex.
    - Moved amsr2 to new dump group (11) to improve performance on Cray-XC40.
    - Removed obsolete/commented block of logic that was added to the script by
      SPA during WCOSS transition (to alert radiosonde related data for DDS).
      
   exglobal_makeprepbufr.sh.ecf:
    - Added step to create nsstbufr file needed for 2017 GFS upgrade analysis.  
    - Added logic to save and alert atmospheric guess files using 2017 GFS
      naming conventions.
    - Added wrappers to check setting of new variable $PROCESS_UNBLKBUFR to
      determine whether or not to create and alert a copy of the output prepbufr
      file with extension "unblok". The default setting is NO.
    - dbn_alerts for gdas prepbufr files will have alert subtype prefix of GDAS
      rather than GDAS1.
 
 Fixed file changes:
   prepobs_errtable.global:
    - Updated wind ob errors for type 247 (GOES clear air water vapor winds)


 Output changes:
 ---------------
   - GDAS files that previously had names that started with "gdas1" will now
     have names that start with "gdas".  Eg, gdas1.t00z.adpupa.tm00.bufr_d 
     becomes gdas.t00z.adpupa.tm00.bufr_d.
   - New files gdas.tCCz.nsstbufr and gfs.tCCz.nsstbufr (for CC=00,06,12,18)
     are created for downstream analysis jobs.  These are simply a concatenation
     of the sfcshp, tesac, bathy, trkob dump files for the given cycle.  They
     are restricted because they contain resticted ship data.
   - Due to the upgrade to obsproc_dump_post.v3.0.0 which uses mail.py rather
     than the mail command, the SDM should start to see mail msgs about dump
     counts for GDAS cycles.
   - As noted in Dissemination section below, unblok versions of bufr_d and
     prepbufr files will no longer be generated.


 Compute Resource Information:
 -----------------------------
   With the move from IBM iDataPlex to Cray-XC40 come significant changes to the
   job cards.  These were provide to SPA in a separate document.
 
   Performance:
     - jgfs_dump and jgdas_dump run times are about the same but with larger
       variance on the cray.
     - jgfs_prep and jgdas_prep runs are faster with this upgrade by ~30s.
     - jgfs_dump_post and jgdas_dump_post jobs are slower (~30s for gfs and ~60s
       for gdas) due to poor performance of the bufr dump file lister on the
       cray.  (i/o buffering did not help).
     - jgfs_prep_post runs are a few seconds slower, jgdas_prep_post runs are
       typically ~15-30 seconds slower. Worst case is the 18z run on the 2nd of
       the month might take an additional two to three minutes due to extra text
       processing to compute monthly summaries of data counts.


 Disk Space Changes:
 -------------------
   Roughly 6.5Gb saved per day in com (and hpss) due to retirement of "unblok"
   files.


 Shared Software (with 1 or more jobs):
 --------------------------------------
    - obsproc_dump.v4.0.0
    - obsproc_prep.v4.0.0
    - obsproc_dump_post.v3.0.0
    - obsproc_prep_post.v3.0.0
    - obsproc_shared/bufr_dumplist.v1.3.0
    - obsproc_shared/bufr_remorest.v2.0.0
    - obsproc_shared/bufr_avgdata.v2.0.0


 Required modules:
 -----------------
  All jobs require:
    prod_util         (tested with 1.0.8, the default at the time)
    prod_envir        (tested with 1.0.1, the default at the time)
  JGDAS_DUMP and JGFS_DUMP require:
    grib_util/1.0.5
    cfp_intel_sandybridge/1.1.0


 Preimplementation Testing Requirements:
 ---------------------------------------
   - Test all eight production jobs.
   - Details provided in a separate document.


 Downstream users:
 ----------------
   - The main users of this output are the GDAS and GFS networks.
   - Dump count information produced by the dump_post jobs are used by
     the models_realtime package.


 Dissemination:
 --------------
   - All files that had filename prefix "gdas1" will be renamed with filename
     prefix "gdas" (unless they are in the list of files to be discontinued).
     The alert subtype is changed accordingly ("GDAS1_" will be "GDAS_")
   - The following versions of bufr dump and prepbufr files will no longer be
     generated and alerted for CC=00,06,12,18:
        gdas1.tCCz.*.tm00.bufr_d.unblok
        gdas1.tCCz.*.tm00.bufr_d.unblok.nr
        gfs.tCCz.prepbufr.unblok
        gfs.tCCz.prepbufr.unblok.nr
        gdas1.tCCz.prepbufr.unblok
        gdas1.tCCz.prepbufr.unblok.nr
     Files with the same content will continue to be available without the
     "unblok" filename qualifier (and with the change in prefix for gdas files).
     Eg, file gdas1.t00z.adpupa.tm00.bufr_d.unblok will be available as
     gdas.t00z.adpupa.tm00.bufr_d and file gfs.t00z.prepbufr.unblok.nr will be
     available as gfs.t00z.prepbufr.nr.  There is one exception to the pattern
     in that gdas1.tCCz.sfcshp.tm00.bufr_d.unblok will be available as
     gdas.tCCz.sfcshp.tm00.bufr_d.nr.
   - When JGFS_PREP is run with swich NEMSIO_IN=.true. (which is the default),
     the atmospheric guess files alerted by this job will be gridded binary
     (nemsio) rather than spectral coordinates (sigio). The nemsio global files
     are 3.55Gb larger than their sigio counterparts. The filenames and
     dbn_alert subtypes are changing as follows:
          Old file       Old Alert           New file              New alert
          --------       ---------           --------              ---------
     gfs.tCCz.sgesprep GFS_sges_PREP -> gfs.tCCz.atmges.nemsio GFS_atmges_NEMSIO
     gfs.tCCz.sgm3prep GFS_sgm3_PREP -> gfs.tCCz.atmgm3.nemsio GFS_atmgm3_NEMSIO
     gfs.tCCz.sgp3prep GFS_sgp3_PREP -> gfs.tCCz.atmgp3.nemsio GFS_atmgp3_NEMSIO

( A - added,  M - modified, D - deleted)


 JOB script changes:
   All job scripts:
    - Move check that required variables are set to top of script.
    - Revised logic that generates version informational output at the start of
      the job for cleaner script and output.
   JGDAS_DUMP, JGFS_DUMP:
    - Set default for new script variable $KEEP_NEARDUP_ACFT to "NO" to ensure
      that near-duplicate aircraft reports will not be retained.
      BENEFIT: Testing has shown that the inclusion of these near-duplicate
               aircraft reports degrades the GFS forecast five days out.  The
               GSI may need to be updated to include thinning of aircraft
               reports before the near-duplicate aircraft reports can be
               introduced.  This switch will allow for an easy change to
               include these data at some future time.
   JGDAS_PREP, JGFS_PREP:
    - Minor comment change.

 Model script changes:
   exglobal_dump.sh.ecf:
    - Added global dumps of "esiasi", "saphir", "crisdb", "esatms", "amsr2",
      "iasidb", "escris", "sevasr" and "atmsdb", all with time window of -3.00
      to +2.99 hours about center dump time. Dumps of "esatms" and "escris" will
      be created only if at least one tank is present in the past 10 days (these
      may have not yet been promoted to /dcom prior to the implementation of
      exglobal_dump.sh.ecf).
      BENEFIT: These will be tested in GFS/GDAS GSI.
    - Added new dump group and reordered cfp commands to improve load balance,
      needed with so many new dump types added.
      BENEFIT: Speeds up run time (~20 sec) over original configuration where
               new dump types were randomly added to just two dump groups.
               [Note: Dump job run times are still slower than before due to the
                      addition of the new dump types (see Compute Resource
                      Information below).]
    - Removed temporary logic added in v2.3.0 which changed "gpsipw" dump file's
      group to "rstprod" and its permission to "640" so that it could only be
      read by users in the rstprod group.  This is no longer needed since
      "gpsipw" has now been added to the list of dump files for which this needs
      to be done in obsproc_dump.v3.3.0 which is being implemented
      simultaneously with obsproc_global.v2.4.0.

 Fixed file changes:
   prepobs_errtable.global:
    - Added temperature and moisture ob errors up to 100 mb for type 134
      (TAMDAR) (was missing).
    - Added uv wind ob errors up to 100 mb for type 234 (TAMDAR) (was missing).
    - Added temperature ob errors at all levels for type 135 (Canadian AMDAR)
      (was missing).
    - Added uv wind ob errors at all levels for type 235 (Canadian AMDAR) (was
      missing).
    BENEFIT: These types will soon be tested for future assimilation. Use will
             be controlled only by convinfo file.
    - Added temperature and moisture ob errors up to 500 mb for types 181
      (surface land SYNOP), 183 (surface w/ est. psfc) and 187 (surface land
      METAR) (was missing).
    - Added uv wind ob errors up to 500 mb for types 281 (surface land SYNOP),
      284 (surface w/ est. pstn) and 287 (surface land METAR).
    BENEFIT: These types may be tested for assimilation someday. Use will be
             controlled only by convinfo file.
    - Set temperature and moisture ob errors to missing above 500 mb for types
      180 (surface marine) and 182 (splash-level dropwinsonde).
    - Set uv wind ob errors to missing above 500 mb for types 280 (surface
      marine), 282 (buoy w/ missing psfc), 283 (SSM/I) and 285 (QuikSCAT).
    BENEFIT: Prevents any chance of assimilation if pressure is grossly bad.
             (Types 180/280, 182, 282 used now; types 283 and 285 were used at
              one time.)

 Parm file changes:
   prepobs_prepdata.gdas.parm, prepobs_prepdata.gfs.parm:
    - The default overrides for AWINDO, JAMASS, JAWIND, IACFTL, AIFNOW and
      FLACMS are extended to accommodate three additional aircraft data types:
      Korean AMDAR (BUFR), AMDAR-catchall (BUFR) and Panasonic (AirDAT) TAMDAR
      (BUFR).  There were six, now there are nine.  Moisture will be processed
      (if available) for all three types, but otherwise they will get the same
      values as previously existing AMDAR types.  These three new aircraft data
      types, like all aircraft types, will be processed and included in the
      PREPBUFR files if found in the "aircft" dump files.
      BENEFIT: Korean AMDAR (BUFR) and AMDAR-catchall (BUFR) will be available
               for assimilation by the GFS/GDAS GSI once found in "aircft" dump
               files (they are not yet there).  Panasonic (AirDAT) TAMDAR (BUFR)
               will be available for testing and eventual assimilation by the
               GFS/GDAS GSI once found in "aircft" dump files (they are not yet
               there).


 Output changes:
 ---------------
   Job JGDAS_DUMP, JGFS_DUMP:
    - Creates new dump files
      /com2/gfs/prod/$RUN.$PDY/$model.t${cyc}z.<file>.tm00.bufr_d ,
      where cyc= 00, 06, 12, 18; RUN= gfs, gdas; model= gfs, gdas1; 
      and file = esiasi, saphir, crisdb, esatms, amsr2, iasidb, escris, sevasr,
      atmsdb. (Note "saphir" dump file is restricted.)
    - "ESIASI" (IASI DB radiances from RARS), "SAPHIR" (MT SAPHIR btemps),
      "CRISDB" (CrIS DB radiances from UW/SSEC), "ESATMS" (ATMS DB btemps from
      RARS), "AMSR2" (AMSR2 btemps), "IASIDB" (IASI DB radiances from UW/SSEC),
      "ESCRIS" (CrIS DB radiances from RARS), "SEVASR" (SEVIRI all-sky
      radiances) and "ATMSDB" (ATMS DB btemps from UW/SSEC) will now appear in
      GFS ("GFS") and GDAS ("GDS") RTDM count graphics.
    - After ARINC switches to v7 BUFR for AMDAR and MDCRS, dump files
      /com2/gfs/prod/$RUN.$PDY/$model.t${cyc}z.aircar.tm00.bufr_d
      (where cyc= 00, 06, 12, 18; RUN= gfs, gdas; model= gfs, gdas1) can
      potentially store lat/lon (CLAT/CLON) to 10**5 precision.
   Job JGDAS_DUMP_POST, JGFS_DUMP_POST:
    - As a result of update to obsproc_dump_post.v2.3.0:
       - Creates new non-restricted dump files
         /com2/gfs/prod/$RUN.$PDY/$model.t${cyc}z.saphir.tm00.bufr_d.nr ,
         where cyc= 00, 06, 12, 18; RUN= gfs, gdas; model= gfs, gdas1.
       - Creates new names for dump alert flag files:
         /com2/gfs/prod/$RUN.$PDY/$model.t${cyc}z.dump_alert_flag.tm00 ,
         where cyc= 00, 06, 12, 18; RUN= gfs, gdas; model= gfs, gdas1.
         (Note: Legacy filenames
                /com2/gfs/prod/$RUN.$PDY/$model.t${cyc}z.dump_alert_flag
                will still be output until JDUMP_ALERT is transitioned to read
                from new filenames.)
       - Creates new names for dump alert log files:
         /com2/logs/alertlog/$RUN.t${cyc}z.tm00 and
         /com2/logs/alertlog/trend_vs_[03][06][09][12]months_ago.$RUN.t${cyc}z.tm00 ,
         where cyc= 00, 06, 12, 18; RUN= gfs, gdas.
         (Note: Legacy filenames
                /com2/logs/alertlog/$RUN.t${cyc}z and
                /com2/logs/alertlog/trend_vs_[03][06][09][12]months_ago.$RUN.t${cyc}z
                will still be output until such time that the filename change
                can be advertised.)
       - Listings for "aircft", "aircar", "adpupa", "adpsfc", "sfcshp",
         "ascatw" and "gpsipw" dumps now print lat/lon out to 0.00001 degree
         (although actual significance is still based on precision in the BUFR
         lat/lon encoded in each dump file).
    - As a result of updates to obsproc_dump.v3.3.0 and obsproc_dump_post.v2.3.0:
       - The updated status files in
         /com2/gfs/prod/[gfs][gdas].<yyyymmdd>/[gfs][gdas1].t<cc>z.updated.status.tm00.bufr_d
         will now contain dump counts and 30-d avg dump counts for new data
         types "esiasi", "saphir", "crisdb", "esatms", "amsr2", "iasidb",
         "escris", "sevasr" and "atmsdb".
   Jobs JGDAS_PREP, JGFS_PREP:
    - As a result of update to obsproc_prep.v3.8.0:
       - E-AMDAR moisture now excoded into PREPBUFR files (not considered by
         assimilation).
       - PREPBUFR files now store lat/lon (YOB/XOB) to 10**5 precision, this
         will potentially be seen for the following types: AIRCFT 131/231
         E-AMDAR (only), AIRCFT 135/235 (Canadian-AMDAR), AIRCAR 133/233 (MDCRS)
         (after ARINC switches to v7 BUFR for AMDAR and MDCRS); as well as in
         GPSIPW 153 since this has 10**5 precision in dumps.

 JOB script changes:
   JGDAS_DUMP, JGFS_DUMP:
    - Points to latest version of obsproc_shared/bufr_dumplist in Phase 2 vs.
      Phase 1 ($NWROOTp2 replaces $NWROOTp1; the transitional setting for
      $NWROOTp2 added).
    - Removed setting of temporary variable EXGRBIX.
    - Remove exported script variable $utilparm (which defaulted to
      /nwprod/util/parm) as it is no longer required by any child scripts.
    - Obtains version number for module grib_util via imported environment
      variable $grib_util_ver.  This is defined in the upstream ecflow script.
      Current setting is grib_util_ver=v1.0.1 (thus module grib_util/v1.0.1
      is still used here).
      BENEFIT: Allows for more flexibility in changing version numbers for this
               module (before this module was hardwired to a specific version
               number).
   JGDAS_DUMP_POST, JGFS_DUMP_POST:
    - Points to latest version of obsproc_dump_post and
      obsproc_shared/bufr_dumplist in Phase 2 vs. Phase 1 ($NWROOTp2 replaces
      $NWROOTp1; the transitional setting for $NWROOTp2 added).
    - More flexible options for specifiying variables $AVGDarch_IN,
      $AVGDarch_OUT and $ALERTL in developer runs.
   JGDAS_PREP, JGFS_PREP:
    - Obtains version number for module util_shared via imported environment
      variable $util_shared_ver.  This is defined in the upstream ecflow script.
      Current setting is util_shared_ver=v1.0.4.
       - Load module util_shared/v1.0.4.
      BENEFIT: Defines prepended path now relied on to run utility ush
               getges.sh in ush script prepobs_makeprepbufr.sh.
    - Now sets GETGES_COM with default of "/com2" if GETGES_COM is not imported
      from driver script.  This always overrides getges.sh default "$COMROOT".
      Before, GETGES_COM first defaulted to "$COMROOT" and then to "/com" if
      COMROOT was not imported from driver script (this had been put in place
      as the GFS/CDAS was transitioning from Phase 1 to Phase 2).
      BENEFIT: Gives more flexibility for cases when a development or test run
               may redirect COMROOT to an alternate location. Avoids the need
               to set GETGES_COM in the driver script in this case.  Also
               allows GETGES_COM to be set to an alternative location in driver
               script.
    - Added GETGES_NWG with default of "/nwges2" if GETGES_NWG is not imported
      from driver script.  This always overrides getges.sh default "$GESROOT".
      BENEFIT: Gives more flexibility for cases when a development or test run
               may redirect GESROOT to an alternate location. Avoids the need
               to set GETGES_NWG in the driver script in this case.  Also
               allows GETGES_NWG to be set to an alternative location in driver
               script.
    - Points to latest version of obsproc_prep in Phase 2 vs. Phase 1 ($NWROOTp2
      replaces $NWROOTp1; the transitional setting for $NWROOTp1 no longer
      needed; the transitional setting for $NWROOTp2 added).
    - Remove exported script variable $utilexec (which defaulted to
      /nwprod/util/exec) as it is no longer required by any child scripts.
   JGDAS_PREP_POST:
    - Obtains version number for module util_shared via imported environment
      variable $util_shared_ver.  This is defined in the upstream ecflow script.
      Current setting is util_shared_ver=v1.0.4.
       - Load module util_shared/v1.0.4 (rather than previous hardwired
         util_shared/v1.0.2).
    - Split imported script variables into separate input and output
      variable as follows:
       - $SATCOM into $SATCOMIN and $SATCOMOUT_dir
       - $DATCOM into $DATCOMIN and $DATCOMOUT_dir
       - $ARCHCOM into $ARCHCOMIN and $ARCHCOMOUT
       - $DATCOM1 into $DATCOM1_IN and $DATCOM1_OUT
      these are all now tuned based on production vs. developer runs.
      BENEFIT: Allows developer runs to specify a production input location and
               a local output location.
    - More flexible options for specifiying variables $VOSarch_IN and
      $VOSarch_OUT in developer runs.
    - Replaces generic $NWROOT with more specific $NWROOTp2 as root to
      obsproc_prep_post in Phase 2 (the transitional setting for $NWROOTp2
      added).
   JGFS_PREP_POST:
    - Remove exported script variable $utilexec (which defaulted to
      /nwprod/util/exec) as it is no longer required by any child scripts.
    - Replaces generic $NWROOT with more specific $NWROOTp2 as root to
      obsproc_prep_post in Phase 2 (the transitional setting for $NWROOTp2
      added).

 Model script changes:
   exglobal_dump.sh.ecf:
    - Replaced "/com" with full file name path beginning with ${COMSP} in
      messages posted to jlogfile when copying 0.5 degree snow grib file, T574
      snow grib file, engice grib file and lowres sst grib file.
      BENEFIT: Adds more information, generalizes now that prod i/o is /com2.
    - Moved GPSIPW from dump group #3 to dump group #4 and adjusted the window 
      from +/- 3-hours to +/- 0.05 hours (3-min) to accommodate the new Ground
      Based GPS-IPW/ZTD (from U.S.-ENI and foreign GNSS providers) in dump
      message type NC012004.
      BENEFIT: These are not yet assimilated by the Global-GSI but they are
               monitored.  This change prevents a potential overload of reports
               from reaching the GSI.  Only reports at cycle time will be
               available for monitoring (similar change made in NAM and RAP,
               networks that do assimilate these data).  (This may be tweaked in
               the future, but done now just to be safe.)
    - Now dumps "adpupa" after all other types are dumped if new environment
      variable $ADPUPA_wait is set to "YES".
      BENEFIT: Set to "YES" in GFS network to maximize RAOB, PIBAL, and,
               especially, RECCO and DROPSONDE data availability. (Set to "NO"
               in GDAS network where the late cutoff means this is not needed.
               When ADPUPA_wait=NO the dump jobs will run a bit faster.
    - Added temporary logic to change "gpsipw" dump file's group to "rstprod"
      and its permission to "640" so that it can only be read by users in the
      rstprod group.
      BENEFIT: New "gpsipw" dump file is restricted.  The logic to restrict dump
               files is done in obsproc_dump ush script bufr_dump_obs.sh, where
               the list of files to restrict is hardwired.  Since obsproc_dump
               is not included in this release bundle, the restriction must be
               done here.  This temporary logic will be removed once a future
               change to add "gpsipw" to the list of dump files to restrict is
               made in the next obsproc_dump release.


 Output changes:
 ---------------
   Job JGDAS_DUMP, JGFS_DUMP:
    - As a result of update to obsproc_shared/bufr_dumplist.v1.3.0:
       - Dump files
         /com2/gfs/prod/[gfs][gdas].<yyyymmdd>/[gfs][gdas1].t<cc>z.gpsipw.tm00.bufr_d
         now contain new U.S.-ENI and foreign-GNSS Ground Based GPS-IPW/ZTD
         (message type NC012004) (before they contained U.S.-GSD Ground Based
         GPS-IPW/ZTD, message type NC012003).  They will also now be restricted.
          - As a result of above, the dump "status" files
            /com2/gfs/prod/[gfs][gdas].<yyyymmdd>/[gfs][gdas1].t<cc>z.status.tm00.bufr_d
            will now reflect a much lower dump count for data group "gpsipw"
            (now in 012.004 as opposed to 012.003 before) since the dump time
            window has been greatly reduced (see below).  This change in dump
            counts will be reflected in the RTDM "Model Data Dump Tables - GFS"
            and "Model Data Dump Tables - GDS" under the new data type "gnss"
            (which replaces "gpspw" which represented the old-GSD feed).
    - The time window for new U.S.-ENI and foreign-GNSS Ground Based
      GPS-IPW/ZTD in dump files
      /com2/gfs/prod/[gfs][gdas].<yyyymmdd>/[gfs][gdas1].t<cc>z.gpsipw.tm00.bufr_d
      is +/- 3-min about cycle time (the time window for previous U.S.-GSD
      Ground Based GPS-IPW/ZTD was +/- 3-hr about cycle time).
   Jobs JGDAS_DUMP_POST, JGFS_DUMP_POST:
    - As a result of update to obsproc_dump_post.v2.2.0:
       - The following new files are created:
         /com2/gfs/prod/[gfs][gdas].<yyyymmdd>/[gfs][gdas1].t<cc>z.gpsipw.tm00.bufr_d.nr
       - The updated status files in
         /com2/gfs/prod/[gfs][gdas].<yyyymmdd>/[gfs][gdas1].t<cc>z.updated.status.tm00.bufr_d
         will now contain dump counts and 30-d avg dump counts for new data type
         "gnss" (new-GSD feed which replaces "gpspw" which represented the old-
         GSD feed).
       - Dump listing files
         /com2/gfs/prod/[gfs][gdas].<yyyymmdd>/[gfs][gdas1].t<cc>z.gpsipw.tm00.bufr_d.listing
         list lat and lon to nearest 0.00001 degree rather than to nearest 0.01
         degree.  These files are now restricted.
       - Information for 30-day average for "GOES/NESDIS infrared short-wave
         derived cloud motion(3p9us)" is now available in files
         /com2/gfs/prod/[gfs][gdas].<yyyymmdd>/[gfs][gdas1].t<cc>z.updated.status.tm00.bufr_d.
         This completes missing data in RTDMS graphics.
   Job JGDAS_PREP, JGFS_PREP:
    - As a result of update to obsproc_prep.v3.7.0:
       - Reports in PREPBUFR files with message type GPSIPW (report type 153)
         will now contain new U.S.-ENI Ground Based GPS-IPW/ZTD at cycle time
         (before they contained U.S.-GSD Ground Based GPS-IPW at 15-min past
         each hour in the dump file).
          - Encodes zenith total delay (when present) and its error into
            PREPBUFR file, represented by "atmospheric path delay in satellite
            signal" (mnemonic APDS) and "error in atmospheric path delay in
            satellite signal" (mnemonic APDE), resp., in association with
            hardwired azimuth angle (mnemonic BEARAZ) of 0.0 (deg) and hardwired
            elevation angle (mnemonic ELEV) of 90.0 (deg).
    - As a result of update to obsproc_prep.v3.6.0:
       - Surface land METAR reports in PREPBUFR files with message type ADPSFC
         (report type 187) will now contain a cloud ceiling field (derived from
         cloud amount and cloud height values) represented by mnemonic CEILING.
         This is not read by the Global-GSI.
   Job JGDAS_PREP_POST, JGFS_PREP_POST:
    - As a result of update to obsproc_prep_post.v2.3.0:
       - Non-restricted PREPBUFR files Files
         /com2/gfs/prod/[gfs][gdas].<yyyymmdd>/[gfs][gdas1].t<cc>z.prepbufr.nr
         /com2/gfs/prod/[gfs][gdas].<yyyymmdd>/[gfs][gdas1].t<cc>z.prepbufr_pre-qc.nr
         /com2/gfs/prod/[gfs][gdas].<yyyymmdd>/[gfs][gdas1].t<cc>z.prepbufr.unblok.nr
         no longer contain any reports in message type "GPSIPW" (as all reports
         are restricted and stripped out)

 Special Instructions:
 ---------------------
   This is part of OBSPROC.v6.4.0.
   This must be implemented simultaneously with the implementations of:
      v2.1.0 of obsproc_cdas,

 JOB script changes:
   All JOB scripts:
    - Use NCO-established variables to point to root directories for main
      software components and input/output directories in order to run on
      WCOSS Phase 1 or Phase 2.  (Some util* variables remain and point to
      /nwprod/util as required by obsproc application scripts).
    - Use NCO-established variables to point to prod and grib utilities.
    - Execute "module list" to echo "Currently Loaded Modulefiles" to stdout.
    - Removed direct path to setpdy.sh utility script, relying on version
      added to PATH (presumably by prod_util module).  Echo full path to this
      script to stdout.
    - Use new NCO standard variable KEEPDATA in place of CLEANUP to decide
      whether to remove working directory at end of run.
    - Removed NCO vs developer checks in places were we could rely on variables
      set in ecflow environment for NCO runs. Modified remaining such wrappers
      to check setting of NCO standard variable RUN_ENVIR in place of 
      non-standard variables used previously.
    - Revised logic that generates version informational output at the start of
      the job for cleaner script and output.
   JGDAS_DUMP and JGFS_DUMP:
    - Load module grib_util/v1.0.1.
      BENEFIT: Defines path now relied on to run utility programs cnvgrib and
               grbindex in model script exglobal_dump.sh.ecf and grbindex in
               ush script bufr_dump_obs.sh.
   JGDAS_DUMP_POST:
    - Added entries for variable comin and comin_m1 to override default
      settings in shared application script bufr_avgdata.sh.
   JGFS_DUMP_POST:
    - Modified to perform data count averaging during 18Z runs of this job.
      New variables include comin and comin_m1 which override default settings
      in shared application script bufr_avgdata.sh.
   JGDAS_PREP and JGFS_PREP:
    - Export GETGES_COM with default of /com which is overridden by $COMROOT if
      the latter is imported from ecflow script.
      BENEFIT: Allows util ush script getges.sh to point to /com2 to obtain
               first guess once GFS/GDAS (and this package) is moved to
               Phase 2.  If this package were, for some reason, implemented
               prior to GFS/GDAS move to Phase 2, getges.sh would continue to
               point to /com to obtain first guess.
   JGDAS_PREP_POST:  
    - Load module util_shared/v1.0.2.
      BENEFIT: Defines path now relied on to run month_name.sh utility script
               in obsproc_prep_post v2.2.0 ush script gdas_summary.sh.
    - Added variable PROCESS_MASTER_SHIP_STNLST to (when YES) run processing in
      obsproc_prep_post (v2.2.0 and beyond) model script exprep_post.sh.ecf to
      update the Master Ship Station List based on any information read from
      the updated VOS ship list from NDBC. This defaults to (and thus is
      exported as) YES in the 18z cycle run of this job and is hardwired to NO
      in all other cycle runs. When set to YES, various directory paths needed
      by this processing are set and exported.
      BENEFIT: See changes to model script exprep_post.sh.ecf in Release Notes
               for v2.2.0 of obsproc_prep_post.
    - Existing variable PROCESS_ALL_REPORT_COUNTS is now hardwired to NO in all
      cycle runs of this job except 18z.  Before, it defaulted to NO in these
      cycle runs.
      BENEFIT: The model script exprep_post.sh.ecf in obsproc_prep_post is
               hardwired to not run this processing unless this is the 18z GDAS
               run. It is not possible to override this and the job script will
               now reflect this.

 Model script changes:
   exglobal_dump.sh.ecf:
    - Use NCO standard variables to point to grib utilities.
    - Rely on PATH to run finddate.sh utility script. Echo full path to this
      script to stdout.
    - Allow the variable TIME_TRIM for be imported as either "on" or "off"
      (i.e., set in job script) and apply to all dump groups, overriding the
      individual default values previously hardwired for each dump group. In
      addition, if TIME_TRIM is not imported, allow new variables TIME_TRIM1,
      TIME_TRIM2, etc. to be imported as either "on" or "off" (i.e., set in job
      script) and apply to specific dump groups (e.g., TIME_TRIM1 applying to
      dump group 1, TIME_TRIM6, applying to dump group 6, etc.), overriding the
      default value(s) for TIME_TRIM previously hardwired for the applicable
      dump group(s).
      BENEFIT: Allows for more flexibility.  E.G., a case where a developer GFS
               or GDAS run uses a time window radius with some fraction of an
               hour (e.g., -0.50 to +0.49) rather than -3.00 to +2.99 if
               running in hourly cycles rather than in six-hour cycles.  Here
               time trimming is needed for all dump groups, thus TIME_TRIM
               could be set to "on" in the job script.
   exglobal_makeprepbufr.sh.ecf:
    - Replace hard path to ndate utility with NCO standard variable $NDATE.

 Fixed file changes:
   prepobs_errtable.global:
    - Add uv wind ob errors for type 296 (RapidScat).
      This change has no impact on current operational output.


 Output changes:
 ---------------
   Job JGDAS_PREP_POST (18z cycle run only):
    - As a result of update to obsproc_prep_post.v2.2.0:
       - Upon implementation, new files /com2/arch/prod/VOS/activeShiprev
         (modified NDBC active ship list) and /com2/arch/prod/VOS/ship_names
         (Master Ship Station List) will be created and then subsequently
         updated daily.
   Jobs JGDAS_DUMP_POST, JGFS_DUMP_POST:
    - As a result of update to obsproc_dump_post.v2.1.0, the following will be
      done by JGFS_DUMP_POST rather than JGDAS_DUMP_POST:
       - update files /com/arch/prod/avgdata/*gfs*
       - update content of directory /com/arch/prod/obcount_30day/gfs


 Compute Resource Information:
 -----------------------------
   Job JGDAS_PREP_POST (18z cycle run only):
    - No change in requested resources in the job cards.
    - No change to memory usage.
    - ~10 second increase in wallclock run time.
   All other jobs and cycles:
    - No change in requested resources in the job cards.
    - No change to memory usage.
    - No change in wallclock run time.


 Disk Space Changes:
 -------------------

    - obsproc_shared/bufr_remorest.v1.0.0
    - obsproc_shared/bufr_avgdata.v1.0.1


 Required modules:
 -----------------
  All jobs require:
    prod_util (expected to be loaded in advance; tested with v1.0.1)
  JGDAS_DUMP and JGFS_DUMP require:
    grib_util/v1.0.1 (loaded in job script)
  JGDAS_PREP_POST requires:
    util_shared/v1.0.2 (loaded in job script)


 Preimplementation Testing Requirements:
 ---------------------------------------
   - Test all eight production jobs.
   - This is part of the parallel test of the GFS Upgrade bundle (FY16Q3).


 Dissemination:
 --------------
   - The main users of this output are the GDAS and GFS networks.
   - No changes in dissemination.
   - No change in archival on HPSS.


 Special Instructions:
 ---------------------
   This is part of OBSPROC.v6.1.0.
   - It is expected that this will be implemented simultaneously with the
     implementation of the FY16Q3 GFS Upgrade bundle on Phase 2.  However, it
     could go in sooner.  Please note, however:
     - This must be implemented on Phase 2 simultaneously with the 
       implementation of obsproc_dump_alert v1.1.0 on Phase 2.  
     - This must be implemented simultaneously with the implementation of 
       obsproc_prep_post v2.2.0 on either Phase 1 or Phase 2.
     - This must be implemented with obsproc_dump_post.v2.1.0 and
       obsproc_nam.v2.1.0 (both of which should be installed on Phase 1).
   - If implementing on WCOSS Phase 1 (prior to move of GFS to run on Phase 2),
     please export the following for all jobs:
       NWROOT=/nwprod
       COMROOT=/com
   - If implementing on WCOSS Phase 2 (with move of GFS to run on Phase 2),
     first copy the following from /com to /com2:
       /com/logs/alertlog/*gdas*
       /com/logs/alertlog/*gfs*
       /com/gfs/prod/satcounts/
       /com/gfs/prod/satcounts_archive/
       /com/arch/prod/data_counts.??????/
       /com/arch/prod/index.shtml
   - The move of RTDM files for all models to /com2 is expected to come at a
     later date. When that time comes, copy the following from /com to /com2:
       /com/arch/prod/avgdata/*dump*
       /com/arch/prod/avgdata/*gdas*
       /com/arch/prod/avgdata/*gfs*
       /com/arch/prod/avgdata/*nam*
       /com/arch/prod/avgdata/*rap*
       /com/arch/prod/avgdata/*rtma*
       /com/arch/prod/avgdata/*urma*
       /com/arch/prod/obcount_30day/dump/
       /com/arch/prod/obcount_30day/gdas/
       /com/arch/prod/obcount_30day/gfs/
       /com/arch/prod/obcount_30day/nam/
       /com/arch/prod/obcount_30day/rap/
       /com/arch/prod/obcount_30day/rtma/
       /com/arch/prod/obcount_30day/urma/
     UNTIL THEN, temporarily add: 
       export HOMEarch=/com/arch/${envir} 
      to ecflow scripts for JGFS_DUMP_POST and JGDAS_DUMP_POST.

   If implementing on WCOSS Phase 1 (prior to move of GFS to run on Phase 2):
   Please export file
   https://svnemc.ncep.noaa.gov/projects/obsproc/branches/VS/versions/20160127_OBSPROC-v6.1.0/obsproc_global.ver
   and copy to /nwprod/versions, replacing like-named file.

   If implementing on WCOSS Phase 2 (with move of GFS to run on Phase 2):
   Please export file
   https://svnemc.ncep.noaa.gov/projects/obsproc/branches/VS/versions/20160127_OBSPROC-v6.1.0/obsproc_global.ver
   and copy to /nwprod2/versions (new file here).

 JOB script changes:
   JGDAS_PREP, JGFS_PREP:
    - Minor comment changes.
   JGDAS_PREP_POST:
     - Added variables to point to gdas counts software in obsproc_prep_post.
     - Removed EXECutil and UTILfix which are no longer needed.
     - Allow developer to import SENDWEB setting (default is NO).
     - Added variable used to trigger rebuild of gdas counts main page.
   JCDAS_DUMP, JCDAS_DUMP_POST, JCDAS_PREP1, JCDAS_PREP1_POST, JCDAS_PREP2,
   JCDAS_PREP2_POST:
    - Removed. All of the CDAS related files were copied from
      obsproc_global.v2.0.2 and updated in the new obsproc.cdas.v2.0.3
      directory which was implemented prior to obsproc_global.v2.1.0.

 Model script changes:
   exglobal_dump.sh.ecf, exglobal_makeprepbufr.sh.ecf:
    - Removed all logic and comments related to CDAS processing. These scripts
      now tailored exclusively to GDAS and GFS.  Model scripts
      excdas_dump.sh.ecf and excdas_makeprepbufr.sh.ecf created in new
      obsproc.cdas.v2.0.3 directory which was implemented prior to
      obsproc_global.v2.1.0.
   exglobal_dump.sh.ecf:
    - Dump window for new satwnd type NC005090 (POES VIIRS) set to -3.00 to
      +2.99 hours about center dump time.
      BENEFIT: These will be tested in the GSI upgrade in the next quarter.
    - Removed ADD_satwnd="005019 005080" since these types are now part of
      the "satwnd" dump group.

 Fixed file changes:
   prepobs_errtable.global:
    - Add moisture errors for ob type 133 (AIRCAR) and wind errors for ob types
      244 (AVHRR/POES IR SATWND) and 260 (VIIRS/POES IR SATWND).
   prepobs_errtable.cdas, prepobs_oiqc.oberrs.cdas:
    - Removed. All of the CDAS related files were copied from
      obsproc_global.v2.0.2 and updated in the new obsproc.cdas.v2.0.3
      directory which was implemented prior to obsproc_global.v2.1.0.

 Parm file changes:
   prepacqc.gdas.parm, prepacqc.gfs.parm:
    - Changed logical namelist switch "l_doprofiles" from FALSE to TRUE.
    - Changed logical namelist switch "l_prof1lvl" from FALSE to TRUE.
    - Added two new local namelist switches:
         "l_mandlvl" set to FALSE
         "tsplines"  set to TRUE
    BENEFIT: Program PREPOBS_PREPACQC will now generate merged aircraft
             profiles of ascending and descending flights and encode them into
             an output PREPBUFR-like file containing only aircraft data
             (l_doprofiles=.T.).  This profile calculation will not interpolate
             obs data to mandatory levels (l_mandlvl=.F.).  Output PREPBUFR-
             like file will also include merged single-level aircraft reports
             not part of any profile (l_prof1lvl=.T.). In the profiles, the
             vertical velocity rate is calculated using Jim Purser's tension-
             spline interpolation utility (tsplines=.T.).  This output
             PREPBUFR-like file will be used by the GSI to obtain aircraft bias
             corrections.  (See Release_Notes.txt for obsproc_prep.v3.5.0 for
             more information on the benefits of using  tension-splines to
             obtain vertical velocity rate.  The GSI changes to use aircraft
             bias are slated for implementation in Q1FY16.)
   prepobs_prepdata.gdas.parm, prepobs_prepdata.gfs.parm:
    - Minor comment changes.
   prepobs_cqcbufr.cdas.parm, prepobs_prepacqc.cdas.parm,
   prepobs_prepdata.cdas.parm, prepobs_prepssmi.cdas.parm,
   prepobs_prevents.cdas.parm:
    - Removed. All of the CDAS related files were copied from
      obsproc_global.v2.0.2 and updated in the new obsproc.cdas.v2.0.3
      directory which was implemented prior to obsproc_global.v2.1.0.


 Output changes:
 ---------------
   Jobs JGDAS_PREP, JGFS_PREP:
    - Two new files will be generated in /com:
       /com/gfs/prod/[gfs][gdas].<yyyymmdd>/[gfs][gdas1].t<cc>z.prepbufr.acft_profiles
       (PREPBUFR-like file containing merged aircraft profiles and single-level
        reports not in profiles).
       /com/gfs/prod/[gfs][gdas].<yyyymmdd>/[gfs][gdas1].t<cc>z.acqc_merged.prof_sorted
       (text listing the contents in above file).
    - As a result of update to obsproc_prep.v3.5.0:
       - The stdout from prepobs_prepdata run will no longer contain a
         diagnostic "invalid producer/sat combination" for every "satwnd" report
         originating from tank NC005080 (POES AVHRR/IR/LW).
       - Valid TSB values will be encoded into PREPBUFR file for reports in
         message type AIRCAR.
       - Marine reports previously, incorrectly deemed over land and flagged
         will now be deemed over water and be available for assimilation.
   Jobs JGDAS_DUMP, JGFS_DUMP:
    - As a result of update to obsproc_dump.v3.2.1:
       - GOES IR/SW wind reports in "satwnd" dumps will have proper RPID
         values.
    - As a result of update to obsproc_shared/bufr_dumplist.v1.2.0:
       - "INFVR" (POES VIIRS/IR/LW) will now appear in GFS and GDAS RTDM count
         graphics.
       - The "satwnd" dump files will contain POES VIIRS/IR/LW winds.
   Jobs JGDAS_DUMP_POST, JGFS_DUMP_POST:
    - As a result of update to obsproc_dump_post.v2.0.1:
       - The "satwnd" dump listings for GOES IR/SW will contain the correct
         quality information.
   Jobs JGDAS_PREP_POST:
    - As a result of update to obsproc_prep_post.v2.1.0:
       - The counts for COSMIC GPS RO data will now be properly placed in new
         monthly tables under:
           http://www.nco.ncep.noaa.gov/pmb/nwprod/gdas/
         and overall content sent to this web site is improved. There is also a
         reduced risk of corruption of the layout of that site's main page.


 Compute Resource Information:
 -----------------------------
   Jobs JGDAS_PREP, JGFS_PREP:
    - No change in requested resources in the job cards.
    - program prepobs_prepacqc now uses more memory due to an increase in
      array parameter "max_reps":
            previous: The maximum resident set size (KB) = 1024368
            now:      The maximum resident set size (KB) = 1366072
    - No other changes to memory usage.
    - ~25 second increase in wallclock run time.
   Jobs JGDAS_DUMP, JGFS_DUMP:
    - No change in requested resources in the job cards.
    - No change to memory usage.
    - A couple of seconds increase in wallclock run time.
   All other jobs:
    - No change in requested resources in the job cards.
    - No change to memory usage.
    - No change in wallclock run time.


 Disk Space Changes:
 -------------------
   /com/gfs/prod/gfs.   - Increase ~70 Mb per day
   /com/gfs/prod/gdas.  - Increase ~87 Mb per day


 Shared Software (with 1 or more jobs):

    - obsproc_shared/bufr_remorest.v1.0.0
    - obsproc_shared/bufr_avgdata.v1.0.1


 Preimplementation Testing Requirements:
 ---------------------------------------
   - Test all eight production jobs.
      - In particular, test 18Z JGDAS_PREP_POST since it invokes the gdas counts
        changes in obsproc_prep_post.v2.1.0.
        Exact details depend on the timing of the test run. Try:
          export PDY=$(date -d yesterday +%Y%m%d)
          export monsummary_dat=$PDY
          export SATCOM_monsum_base=/com/gfs/prod

obsproc_global release 2.1.0 --> released Aug 10, 2014, updated Nov 04, 2014
                             --> implemented Jan 14, 2015

Note: Prior to this implementation, all of the CDAS related files were
       copied from obsproc_global.v2.0.2 and updated in the new
       obsproc.cdas.v2.0.3 directory which was implemented prior to
       obsproc_global.v2.1.0.  Even though all of the CDAS files remain in
       obsproc_global.v2.1.0 with some being changed as noted below, these
       files will not be used by production.

 M obsproc_global/scripts/exglobal_dump.sh.ecf
( A - added,  M - modified, D - deleted)


 JOB script changes:
   JGDAS_PREP, JGFS_PREP:
    - Modify the setting of NSPLIT variable used to break up data for parallel
      processing.  The (default) setting is now 3 due to the size of expected 
      global background fields (T1534) and current memory limitations.
    - Turn off call to PREPOBS_OIQCBUFR processing.
    - Add comments and settings in preparation for potential upgrade to use
      poe rather than background threads for parallel processing in
      prepobs_makeprepbufr.sh (under development in obsproc_prep application
      package).
   JCDAS_DUMP, JGDAS_DUMP, JGFS_DUMP:
    - Remove reference to TRMM in comments.
   JGDAS_PREP_POST:
    - Allow user nwprod to import COMIN1 if needed to ease testing.
   All J-SCRIPTS:
    - Modified DBNet settings for NCO's non-prod runs.

 Model script changes:
   exglobal_dump.sh.ecf:
    - Add ecFlow trigger for new surface prep job (GFS and GDAS only).
    - Widen the dump window for hourly GOES satwnd for GFS and GDAS runs.
    - Add the following satwnd subtypes for GFS and GDAS runs:
      - NOAA/METOP AVHRR SATWIND infrared cloud motion vector
      - NESDIS/GOES 3.9 micron channel derived cloud motion vector
    - No longer dumps TRMM data.  (These data are not assimilated.  Ingest
      will soon be discontinued as the satellite is nearing end of life).
    - Extra warning posted for unexpectedly missing snow files.
    - No longer fails if an expected surface grib field cannot be found for
      GFS and GDAS runs.
    - Remove DBNet alerts for older surface (ice, snow, sst) fields that
      will no longer be used by operational GFS and GDAS jobs.
    - Remove grib2 inventory generation for these same older fields.
    - Add parallel scripting option to replace background threads for 
      simultaneous dump group processing.
      BENEFIT: Use of the new parallel scripting option with proper resource
               settings reduces run time for this script and possibly that
               for other high i/o processes running on the same node.
    - Minor dump group shuffling to improve timing.

 Fixed file changes:
   prepobs_errtable.global:
    - Double the observation errors for ob types 245 (GOES IR satwnd) and
      246 (GOES imager water vapor satwnd).
    - Add observation errors for ob type 254 (EUMETSAT imager water vapor
      satwnd).
   

 Output changes:
 ---------------
   Jobs JCDAS_DUMP, JGDAS_DUMP, JGFS_DUMP:
    - Dump files "trmm" and "sptrmm" will no longer be added to
      /com/[cdas][gfs]/prod/... directories.
      (Update: This particular change will no longer actually apply to
      /com/cdas/prod because the production version of JCDAS_DUMP is now
      managed under the obsproc_cdas package as explained above.)
    - "TRMM" will no longer appear in GDAS and GFS RTDM count graphics.
   Jobs JGDAS_DUMP, JGFS_DUMP:
    - The number of GOES reports in the "satwnd" dumps will increase
      approximately 6-fold.
    - The "satwnd" dumps will now contain winds from both POES AVHRR and from
      the GOES 3.9 micron channel.
   Jobs JGDAS_PREP, JGFS_PREP:
    - PREPBUFR files will no longer contain OIQCBUFR quality marks (these were
      ignored by the GFS GSI).

   - Recommend: parallel, exclusive, 3 tasks, ptile=3
       (or mem=7000 per task if shared)
     Runtime increased from ~3 minutes to ~4 minutes.

    Note, the poe settings for JGDAS_PREP and JGFS_PREP have no impact at the
    time of initial handoff but may come into play with a future obsproc_prep 
    upgrade.


 Disk Space Changes:
 -------------------
   /com/gfs/prod/gfs.   - Increase ~400 Mb per day
   /com/gfs/prod/gdas.  - Increase ~700 Mb per day
   /com/cdas/prod/cdas. - Decrease ~330 Mb per day (This particular change is no
        longer expected in production due to breakout of cdas related jobs
        mentioned above.)

    - Removed the dumping of AMSR-E data ("amsre"), AMSU-B data ("1bamub",
      "esamub") and HIRS-3 data ("1bhrs3").
      BENEFIT: These data are no longer processed.  The only dumps being
               produced are "esamub", but these contain all missing btemps.


 Output changes:
 ---------------
   JCDAS_PREP1, JCDAS_PREP2, JGDAS_PREP, JGFS_PREP:
    - As a result of update to obsproc_prep.v3.2.0:
       - DFQ now encoded in PREPBUFR file in some cases for surface data.
       - WQM will not be encoded in PREPBUFR file if UOB and VOB are missing
         for surface data.
       - DFP now encoded in PREPBUFR file in some cases for surface data.
       - DFR now encoded in PREPBUFR file in some cases for surface data.
       - SYNDATA bogus winds will no longer be missing in some situations where
         they are expected to be generated due to previous, but now corrected,
         cases which had caused abnormal termination of SYNDAT_SYNDATA.
   Job JCDAS_DUMP, JGDAS_DUMP, JGFS_DUMP:
    - The small dump file "esamub" (containing no usable data) will no longer
      be present in /com/[cdas][gfs]/prod/... directories.
    - "ESAMUB" will no longer appear in GDAS and GFS RTDM count graphics.
   Job JGDAS_DUMP_POST (18z cycle run only):
    - As a result of update to obsproc_shared/bufr_avgdata.v1.0.1:
       - The obcount_30day directories (/com/arch/prod/obcount_30day/$model,
         for model=gfs,gdas,nam) will now retain 32 days worth of files instead
         of 30 days. Despite retaining 32 days of files, averages will continue
         to be constructed from only the past 30 days.

 JOB script changes:
   All JOB scripts:
    - Require that the developer export their own particular temporary
      directory root ($DATAROOT) into the job scripts. If $DATAROOT is not set
      in these scripts, the script will abort.
      NOTE: This does not affect production.
      BENEFIT: This avoids having to hardwire a development-specific default
               temporary directory root in these job scripts. This can now be
               different for different development groups.
   JCDAS_PREP1, JCDAS_PREP2, JGDAS_PREP, JGFS_PREP:
    - Initial population into vertical structure.
    - Changed all "date" commands to "date -u" since WCOSS should always
      present date in UTC.
    - Obtains obsproc_global and obsproc_prep version numbers via imported
      environment variables $obsproc_global_ver and $obsproc_prep_ver, resp.
      These are defined in the upstream ecflow script.
    - Full environmental equivalence.  Streamlined, allows for more
      generalization (e.g., for developer runs).
    - Exports new environment variable $HOMEobsproc_prep which points to
      directory path for generic prep subdirectories under version control
      (in production this is normally /nwprod/obsproc_prep.$obsproc_prep_ver).
      Replaces /nw${envir} in order to point to files in exec, fix and ush
      directories moved from horizontal to vertical directory structure.
    - Exports new environment variable $HOMEobsproc_network which points to
      directory path for network-specific prep subdirectories under version
      control (in production this is normally
      /nwprod/obsproc_global.$obsproc_global_ver).  Replaces /nw${envir} in
      order to point to files in scripts, parm and fix directories moved from
      horizontal to vertical directory structure.
   JGDAS_PREP, JGFS_PREP:
    - Export environment variable $errPREPDATA_limit as "4" at all center hour
      (cycle) times. Before, it was set to default of "0" at all center hour
      times in obsproc_prep ush script prepobs_makeprepbufr.sh.
      BENEFIT: PREPOBS_PREPDATA will no longer abort in any center hour (cycle)
               time run when it finds no data in either the input "adpupa" or
               "adpsfc" dump files. A diagnostic will be printed in stdout.
               The modern GSI can run ok if these data are not available for
               some unexpected reason.
   JCDAS_PREP1_POST, JCDAS_PREP2_POST, JGDAS_PREP_POST, JGFS_PREP_POST:
    - Initial population into vertical structure.
    - Changed all "date" commands to "date -u" since WCOSS should always
      present date in UTC.
    - Obtains obsproc_global, obsproc_prep_post and
      obsproc_shared/bufr_remorest version numbers via imported environment
      variables $obsproc_global_ver, $obsproc_prep_post_ver and
      $obsproc_shared_bufr_remorest_ver, resp.  These are defined in the
      upstream ecflow script.
    - Full environmental equivalence.  Streamlined, allows for more
      generalization (e.g., for developer runs).
    - Exports new environment variable $HOMEobsproc_prep_post which points to
      directory path for generic prep_post subdirectories under version control
      (in production this is normally
      /nwprod/obsproc_prep_post.$obsproc_prep_post_ver).  Replaces /nw${envir}
      in order to point to files in scripts directory moved from horizontal to
      vertical directory structure.
    - Exports new environment variable $HOMEobsproc_network which points to
      directory path for network-specific subdirectories under version control
      (in production this is normally
      /nwprod/obsproc_global.$obsproc_global_ver).  Replaces /nw${envir}.
    - Exports new environment variable $HOMEobsproc_shared_bufr_remorest which
      points to directory path for generic shared bufr_remorest subdirectories
      under version control (in production this is normally
      /nwprod/obsproc_shared/bufr_remorest.${obsproc_shared_bufr_remorest_ver).
      Replaces /nw${envir} in order to point to files in exec and ush
      directories moved from horizontal to vertical directory structure.
   JCDAS_PREP1_POST:
    - Added more robust logic to select PDY, where this is based on cycle time
      to avoid any possibility of obtaining a PDY late by 1 day due to a delay
      in the production run. Added environmental equvalence for cases when
      developer wrapper script exports variable "PDY" into this script.  All of
      this updated logic matches that currently found in other CDAS job
      scripts.
   JCDAS_DUMP_POST, JGDAS_DUMP_POST, JGFS_DUMP_POST:
    - Initial population into vertical structure.
    - Changed all "date" commands to "date -u" since WCOSS should always
      present date in UTC.
    - Obtains obsproc_global, obsproc_dump_post and
      obsproc_shared/bufr_remorest version numbers via imported environment
      variables $obsproc_global_ver, $obsproc_dump_post_ver and
      $obsproc_shared_bufr_remorest_ver, resp.  These are defined in the
      upstream ecflow script.
    - Full environmental equivalence.  Streamlined, allows for more
      generalization (e.g., for developer runs).
    - Exports new environment variable $HOMEobsproc_dump_post which points to
      directory path for generic dump_post subdirectories under version control
      (in production this is normally
      /nwprod/obsproc_dump_post.$obsproc_dump_post_ver).  Replaces /nw${envir}
      in order to point to files in scripts, exec and (in GDAS and GFS networks
      only) ush directories moved from horizontal to vertical directory
      structure.
    - Exports new environment variable $HOMEobsproc_network which points to
      directory path for network-specific subdirectories under version control
      (in production this is normally
      /nwprod/obsproc_global.$obsproc_global_ver).  Replaces /nw${envir}.
    - Exports new environment variable $HOMEobsproc_shared_bufr_remorest which
      points to directory path for generic shared bufr_remorest subdirectories
      under version control (in production this is normally
      /nwprod/obsproc_shared/bufr_remorest.${obsproc_shared_bufr_remorest_ver).
      Replaces /nw${envir} in order to point to files in exec and ush
      directories moved from horizontal to vertical directory structure.
    JGDAS_DUMP_POST, JGFS_DUMP_POST:
    - Obtains obsproc_shared/bufr_dumplist version number via imported
      environment variable $obsproc_shared_bufr_dumplist_ver.  This is defined
      in the upstream ecflow script.
    - Exports new environment variable $HOMEobsproc_shared_bufr_dumplist which
      points to directory path for generic shared bufr_dumplist subdirectories
      under version control (in production this is normally
      /nwprod/obsproc_shared/bufr_dumplist.${obsproc_shared_bufr_dumplist_ver).
      Replaces /nw${envir} in order to point to files in fix directory moved
      from horizontal to vertical directory structure.
   JGDAS_DUMP_POST:
    - Obtains obsproc_shared/bufr_avgdata version number via imported
      environment variable $obsproc_shared_bufr_avgdata_ver.  This is defined
      in the upstream ecflow script.
    - Exports new environment variable $HOMEobsproc_shared_bufr_avgdata which
      points to directory path for generic shared bufr_avgdata subdirectories
      under version control (in production this is normally
      /nwprod/obsproc_shared/bufr_avgdata.${obsproc_shared_bufr_avgdata_ver).
      Replaces /nw${envir} in order to point to files in exec and ush
      directories moved from horizontal to vertical directory structure.
   JCDAS_DUMP, JCDAS_PREP2_POST, JCDAS_DUMP_POST:
    - Added environmental equvalence for cases when developer wrapper script
      exports variable "PDY" into this script.

 Model script changes:
   exglobal_makeprepbufr.sh.ecf:
    - Initial population into vertical structure.
    - Modified to change path to prepobs_makeprepbufr.sh from $ushscript to
      $ushscript_prep as obsproc_prep package has been populated into vertical
      structure.
   exglobal_dump.sh.ecf:
    - No longer attempts to dump OSCAT data.
      BENEFIT: This is a waste of time now that the instrument has died
               (2/20/14).
    - Minor syntax changes to reduce unncecssary error msgs (and other cleanup).

 Fixed file changes:
   prepobs_errtable.cdas, prepobs_errtable.global, prepobs_oiqc.oberrs,
   prepobs_oiqc.oberrs.cdas:

    - New switch NPKRPT (12*FALSE) to control processing of surface obs with
      missing pressure information (FALSE here means these will continue to be

 Output changes:
 ---------------
   Jobs JCDAS_PREP1, JCDAS_PREP2, JGDAS_PREP, JGFS_PREP:
    - As a result of update to obsproc_prep.v3.0.0:
       - Satellite zenith angle (degrees) encoded into PREPBUFR file (mnemonic
         "SAZA") for all satwnd types.
       - Surface marine reports will now encode pmsl ob and qc (PMO and PMQ) in
         PREPBUFR file if pmsl is reported.
       - SFCSHP reports with calm winds and non-missing background u- or v-
         component wind .ge. 5 m/sec are flagged with Q.M. 8 in PREPBUFR file.
       - Coast Guard surface marine mass and wind data will now be processed as
         part of report type 180/280 (when pressure information is available)
         in PREPBUFR file.
       - Surface reports with incomplete wind information will now be retained
         and encoded into the PREPBUFR file.
       - Report type 183 now stores moisture quality mark no lower than 3
         (suspect).
   Jobs JCDAS_DUMP_POST, JGDAS_DUMP_POST, JGFS_DUMP_POST:
    - As a result of update to obsproc_dump_post.v2.0.0:
       - Printing format changed slightly in some dump listing files in /com to
         squeeze more information on a line.
       - Satellite zenith angle (degrees) added to satwnd dump listing files in
         /com/[cdas][gfs]/prod/... directories.

   - The main users of this output are the CDAS, GDAS and GFS networks.
   - No change in dissemination.
   - No change in archival on HPSS.


 Special Instructions:
 ---------------------
   This is part of OBSPROC.v3.0.0.
   This must be implemented simultaneously with the implementations of
   obsproc_dump_monitor.v1.2.0, obsproc_nam.v2.0.0, obsproc_rap.v2.0.0,
   obsproc_rtma.v2.0.0, obsproc_urma.v2.0.0, obsproc_dump.v3.1.0,

obsproc_global release 1.1.0 --> released Feb 9, 2014
                             --> implemented May 6, 2014

files added, modified or deleted since last release:
 M obsproc_global/scripts/exglobal_dump.sh.ecf
( A - added,  M - modified, D - deleted)


 Model script changes:
   exglobal_dump.sh.ecf:
    - Modified to dump GOES IR, water vapor, and visible satellite-derived
      winds using a time window of -1.00 to -0.01 hours relative to cycle time
      for the CDAS, GDAS and GFS rather than -1.50 to +1.50 hours relative to
      cycle time.
      BENEFIT: NESDIS is changing the frequency of their GOES satellite
               derived winds from 3-hourly to 1-hourly. The change to
               exglobal_dump.sh.ecf will allow one complete wind set to
               continue to be dumped and assimilated (not changing the time
               window would triple the number of winds dumped and assimilated,
               all over the same locations). This change will also allow winds
               closer to cycle time to now be assimilated.

 JOB script changes:
   JCDAS_DUMP, JGDAS_DUMP, JGFS_DUMP:
    - Changed all "date" commands to "date -u" since WCOSS should always
      present date in UTC.
    - Obtains obsproc_global, obsproc_dump and obsproc_shared/bufr_dumplist
      version numbers via imported environment variables $obsproc_global_ver,
      $obsproc_dump_ver and obsproc_shared_bufr_dumplist_ver, resp.
      These are defined in the upstream ecflow script.
    - Full environmental equivalence.  Streamlined, allows for more
      generalization (e.g., for developer runs).
    - Exports new environment variable $HOMEobsproc_dump which points to
      directory path for generic dump subdirectories under version control
      (in production this is normally /nwprod/obsproc_dump.$obsproc_dump_ver).
      Replaces /nw${envir} in order to point to files in exec, fix and ush
      directories moved from horizontal to vertical directory structure.
    - Exports new environment variable $HOMEobsproc_network which points to
      directory path for network-specific dump subdirectories under version
      control (in production this is normally
      /nwprod/obsproc_global.$obsproc_global_ver).  Replaces /nw${envir} in
      order to point to files in scripts and parm directory moved from
      horizontal to vertical directory structure.
    - Exports new environment variables $HOMEobsproc_shared_bufr_dumplist and
      $FIXobsproc_shared_bufr_dumplist which point to directory path for
      bufr_dumplist fixed file under version control (in production the latter
      is normally
   /nwprod/obsproc_shared/bufr_dumplist.$obsproc_shared_bufr_dumplist_ver/fix).
      Replaces /nw${envir}/fix from old horizontal directory structure.
   JCDAS_DUMP:
    - Uses "cp -p" rather than "cp when copying files to /com/arkv directory
      in order to preserve group ownership as "rstprod" for restricted files.
   JGDAS_DUMP, JGFS_DUMP:
    - Exports new directory path variables for additional ice and sst files.

 Model script changes:
   exglobal_dump.sh.ecf:
    - $USHobsproc_dump replaces $utilscript as the environment variable
      representing the directory path to the ush script check_tanks.sh.
    - Modified to now dump OSCAT scatterometer data in "oscatw" using a time
      window of -3.00 to +2.99 hours relative to cycle time for the CDAS, GDAS
      and GFS.
      BENEFIT: GFS/GDAS parallel runs are now looking at these data.
      N O T I C E:  By the time this was implemented, OSCAT data were no longer
                    available.  The instrument stopped working on 2/20/14 and
                    was declared as "Dead" on 4/3/14.
    - Modified to skip the dumping of NeXRaD VAD winds from level 2 decoder
      (type 002, subtype 017) as part of the "vadwnd" dump ["vadwnd" will still
      contain only NeXRaD VAD winds from radar coded message (type 002, subtype
      008) for now].
      BENEFIT: The default is to now include NeXRaD VAD winds from the level 2
               decoder in the "vadwnd" dump file (as they will be used in the
               next NAM bundle).  The Global GSI cannot handle these at this
               time.
    - Modified to turn off the check for the existence of "wndsat" data tanks
      and thus any attempt to dump these data..
      BENEFIT: The WindSat scatterometer data ingest feed is currently broken
               as these data are now being produced under a new format that
               NCEP does not recognize.  As we transition to the new feed,
               we do not want to inadvertently dump these data in operations.
    - Modified to pick up additional ice, sst, and snow files.
      BENEFIT: GFS/GDAS parallel runs are now looking at these data.

 Parm file changes:
   prepobs_prepssmi.cdas.parm, prepobs_prepssmi.gdas.parm,
   prepobs_prepssmi.gfs.parm:
    - No changes to contents.


 Output changes:
 ---------------
   Jobs JCDAS_DUMP, JGDAS_DUMP, JGFS_DUMP:
    - Creates new dump files
      /com/$NET/prod/$RUN.$PDY/$model.t${cyc}z.oscatw.tm00.bufr_d ,
      where cyc= 00, 06, 12, 18; NET= cdas and model= cdas for RUN= cdas;
      NET= gfs and model= gdas1 for RUN= gdas; and NET= gfs and model= gfs for
      RUN= gfs. --> NO, OSCAT DIED!!
    - "ascatw" dump files will now contain scatterometer winds from METOP-B (as
      well as from METOP-A from before).
    - As a result of update to obsproc_dump.v3.0.0:
       - If there are zero aircraft reports, processing will not seg fault in
         BUFR_DUPAIR.
   Job JCDAS_DUMP:
    - Users in the "rstprod" group will now be able to read restricted dump
      files in the /com/arkv directory.


 Compute Resource Information:
 -----------------------------
   Jobs JCDAS_DUMP, JGDAS_DUMP, JGFS_DUMP:
    - the "ascatw" dump files will now be approximately twice as large
      since they will now include METOP-B (as well as METOP-A from before)
         CDAS: ascatw increases from ~ 17 MBytes/day to ~ 34 MBytes/day
         GDAS: ascatw increases from ~ 17 MBytes/day to ~ 34 MBytes/day
         GFS:  ascatw increases from ~ 14 MBytes/day to ~ 28 MBytes/day
    - disk space required per day for all new output dump files is:
        cdas: oscatw   ~  88 MBytes --> NO, OSCAT DIED!!
        gdas: oscatw   ~  87 MBytes --> NO, OSCAT DIED!!
        gfs:  oscatw   ~  66 MBytes --> NO, OSCAT DIED!!
        TOTAL:       ~   241 MBytes --> NO, OSCAT DIED!!
    - disk space required per day for all new ice, sst & snow grib files is:
        gfs:  fields   ~ 172 MBytes
        gdas: fields   ~ 172 MBytes
        TOTAL:       ~   344 MBytes
    - 3 second increase in wallclock run time
    - uses code from obsproc_dump.v3.0.0
    - uses code from obsproc_shared/bufr_dumplist.v1.0.0
    - no other changes


 Preimplementation Testing Requirements:
 ---------------------------------------
   - Test production jobs JCDAS_DUMP, JGDAS_DUMP, JGFS_DUMP.
   - All changes in this version (1.0.0) will be tested when the next version
     (1.1.0) is tested as part of the parallel-production test of the hourly
     GOES satellite winds.


 Dissemination:
 --------------
   - The main users of this output are the CDAS, GDAS and GFS networks.
   - No change in dissemination.
   - No change in archival on HPSS.


 Special Instructions:
 ---------------------
   This is part of OBSPROC.v1.0.0.
   This must be implemented simultaneously with the implementations of
   obsproc_dump_monitor.v1.0.0, obsproc_dump.v3.0.0, obsproc_nam.v1.0.0,
   obsproc_rap.v1.0.0, obsproc_rtma.v1.1.0, obsproc_urma.v1.1.0,
   obsproc_satingest.v2.0.0, obsproc_shared/bufr_cword.v1.0.0 and
   obsproc_shared/bufr_dumplist.v1.0.0.

   It should be implemented PRIOR to NESDIS' promotion of their hourly GOES
   satellite winds to their production server,

   Please copy new file
   /meso/save/Dennis.Keyser/HOME/versions/obsproc_global.ver to
   /nwprod/versions.
