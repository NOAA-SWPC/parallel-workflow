 Model script changes:
   exprep_post.sh.ecf:
    - Removed SENDWEB wrapper around call to gdas_summary.sh so that stats can
      be computed even if the info won't be posted to the web.
    - Updated pointers to software that has been imported from /nwprod/util
      into this package and removed hardwired pointers to the common utils.
    - Fail immediately if can't find gdas nor gfs prepbufr file for current
      cycle required to check for TimeTwins.
    - Set new required variables that may not be passed in from older J-scripts.

 USH script changes:
   build_mainpage.sh
    - New.  Used to generate new main page upon request.
   gdas_summary.sh
    - New.  Copied from /nwprod/util/ush and modified as follows:
       - Updated pointers to other software likewise imported from /nwprod/util.
       - Added variables in place of hardwired settings to aid non-prod runs. 
       - Added option to send html updates to developer web space for checkout.
   gdas_countstat.sh

       - Updated pointers to other software likewise imported from /nwprod/util.
       - Made additional minor changes to reduce unnecessary warnings.
   satellite_summary.sh
    - New.  Copied from /nwprod/util/ush and modified as follows:
       - Updated pointers to other software likewise imported from /nwprod/util.
       - Updated the parsing of cosmic/gps info in order to post those counts
         properly in the stats table.  (The old logic was obsolete following the
         May 2012 GFS/GDAS upgrade).
       - Made additional minor changes to reduce unnecessary warnings.
   gdascounts_combine.sh
    - New.  Copied from /nwprod/util/ush and modified as follows:
        - Added ksh shebang to allow the script to run properly on WCOSS.
        - Added checks to reduce risk of table corruption if a month is rerun.
        - Allow for input html file with less than 100 or more than 999 lines.
        - Add option REBUILD_MAINPAGE to recreate a complete home page.

    - New.  Used as input to regenerate main page upon request.
   gdascounts_html
    - New.  Copied from /nwprod/util/fix and modified as follows:
        - % Input values in Conventional Obs table are masked due to
          innacuracy and ambiguity.

 Output changes:
 ---------------
   This upgrade improves content sent to http://www.nco.ncep.noaa.gov/pmb/nwprod/gdas/
   by job JGDAS_PREP_POST (in obsproc_global package).


 Libraries:
 ----------
   w3nco   2.0.6 (global_postevents)
   w3emc   2.2.0 (global_postevents)
   bufr   10.2.5 (global_postevents)
   bacio   2.0.1 (global_postevents)
   sigio   1.0.1 (global_postevents)

 Build Instructions:
 -------------------
   - See sorc/README.build


 Preimplementation Testing Requirements:
 ---------------------------------------
   Test J*PREP_POST for any model upgrading to this version. Changes
   here should only impact obsproc_global/jobs/JGDAS_PREP_POST.
   To test gdas counts changes, test 18Z JGDAS_PREP_POST.
   Exact details depend on the timing of the test run. Try:
     export PDY=$(date -d yesterday +%Y%m%d)
     export monsummary_dat=$PDY
     export SATCOM_monsum_base=/com/gfs/prod
     export DATCOM_monsum_base=/com/arch/prod 
     export REBUILD_MAINPAGE=YES
   Contact ObsProc Team for assistance.

( M - modified)


 Model script changes:
   exprep_post.sh.ecf:
    - Removed all processing for PROCESS_SATELLITE_COUNTS since 
      /nwprod/ush/global_satcount.sh is obsolete.

 Source code changes:
   load_libs.rc and setlibs.rc in sorc directory:
    - Increment the sp version from v2.0.1 to v2.0.2 to link to the newest
      operational version of this library.
   load_libs.rc in sorc directory:
    - remove "module use -a /nwprod/lib/modulefiles" and
             "module avail"
      BENEFIT: No longer needed and can slow down compilation.


 Output changes:
 ---------------
   No changes. (PROCESS_SATELLITE_COUNTS was previously set to NO in all
   applicable network PREP_POST jobs.)


 Shared Software:
 ----------------
    - Source code global_postevents:
         links to version 2.0.6 of w3nco library
         links to version 10.2.5 of bufr library
         links to version 2.2.0 of w3emc library
         links to version 2.0.1 of bacio library
         links to version 2.0.2 of sp library (previously version 2.0.1)
         links to version 1.0.1 of sigio library


 Preimplementation Testing Requirements:
 ---------------------------------------
   There are no jobs in obsproc_prep_post.  All jobs executing this version of
   obsproc_prep_post will be part of the parallel-production test of the
   OBSPROC FY14Q4 bundle.

 Model script changes:
   exprep_post.sh.ecf:
    - Environment variable $REMX (complete path to bufr_remorest executable)
      no longer defaults to /nwprod/exec/bufr_remorest but rather to
      $EXECobsproc_shared_bufr_remorest/bufr_remorest as bufr_remorest package
      has been populated into vertical structure.
    - Modified to change path to ush bufr_remorest.sh from $ushscript_remorest
      to $USHobsproc_shared_bufr_remorest as bufr_remorest package has been
      populated into vertical structure.

 USH script changes:
   global_postevents.sh:
    - No changes (other than move to vertical structure).

 Source code changes:
   build.sh in sorc directory:
    - New. Used to build executable global_postevents in the
      global_postevents.fd sub-directory of the sorc directory.  Reads either
      load_libs.rc or setlibs.rc file to point to library version numbers
      needed by makefile.
   clean.sh in sorc directory:
    - New. Used to "make clean" global_postevents.fd sub-directory in the sorc
      directory (generally after a build).
   install.sh in sorc directory:
    - New. Used to install (move) executable global_postevents (after build) in
      exec directory (assumed to be in same root directory as sorc).
   load_libs.rc in sorc directory:
    - New. Read by build.sh - contains library version numbers needed by
      makefile.  (Not read if setlibs.rc is read.)
   README.build in sorc directory:
    - New. Documentation on using build.sh, install.sh and clean.sh.
   setlibs.rc in sorc directory:
    - New. Read by build.sh - contains library version numbers needed by
      makefile.  (Not read if load_libs.rc is read.)
   global_postevents:
      gblevents (in w3emc library - version 2.2.0):
       - The changes in gblevents are not applicable to global_postevents
         because it runs in the "POSTEVENTS" mode.
      gblevents:
       - No change to source.
    - Makefile modified to use environment variables to point to library
      version numbers and to add sample build script and info in sorc
      directory.  This generalizes the library version information.


 Output changes:
 ---------------
   No changes.


 Compute Resource Information:
 -----------------------------
   Source code global_postevents:
    - continues to link to version 2.0.6 of w3nco library
    - continues to link to version 10.2.5 of bufr library
    - now links to version 2.2.0 of w3emc library (previously linked to
      version 2.0.5)
    - continues to link to version 2.0.1 of bacio library
    - continues to link to version 2.0.1 of sp library
    - continues to link to version 1.0.1 of sigio library


 Preimplementation Testing Requirements:
 ---------------------------------------
   There are no jobs in obsproc_prep_post.  All jobs executing this version of
   obsproc_prep_post will be part of the parallel-production test of the
   OBSPROC Phase 2 bundle.


 Dissemination:
 --------------
   See information about dissemination in the latest release notes for
   obsproc_<NETWORK> packages which execute this version of obsproc_prep_post.


 Special Instructions:
 ---------------------
   This must be implemented simultaneously with the implementations of
   obsproc_dump_monitor.v1.2.0, obsproc_global.v2.0.0, obsproc_nam.v2.0.0,
   obsproc_rap.v2.0.0, obsproc_rtma.v2.0.0, obsproc_urma.v2.0.0,
   obsproc_dump.v3.1.0, obsproc_dump_post.v2.0.0, obsproc_prep.v3.0.0,
   obsproc_satingest.v2.2.0, obsproc_shared/bufr_remorest.v1.0.0 and
   obsproc_shared/bufr_avgdata.v1.0.0.

   This must also be implemented simultaneously with or immediately after the
   w3emc_v2.2.0 implementation.

   Since there are no jobs in obsproc_prep_post, an obsproc_prep_post.ver file
   is not needed.
